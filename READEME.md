# Cognet

***Node Graph Engine for Visual Programming and Data Flow Management***

Cognet is a node graph engine designed to support visual programming and data flow management. It does not provide a GUI but offers a flexible and highly extensible engine for manipulating nodes and their connections. This allows users to easily integrate the engine into their own interfaces or applications, enabling the construction and control of complex workflows for tasks such as algorithm design, data pipeline management, and visual effects creation.
